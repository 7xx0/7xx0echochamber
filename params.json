{"body":"# I hate people\r\nI always seem to be trying to convince myself that I like people. That it's fun to be in the presence of other humans. But I don't and it's not. I *hate* people. They will *always* fuck you over. In some way or another, they will. I have met a single person, in 25 years, that has not fucked me over. Good thing I married that person, seemingly the only use for the archaic ceremony. \r\n\r\nSo, people will always fuck you over. Whether it's a subtle fuck (like being a bitch to you for no apparent reason), or a mighty fuck (like standing you up on one of the most important days of your life). \r\n\r\nI'm done. **I'm done.**\r\n\r\nI'll see how I can distance myself from everyone, but still collect enough money to survive.","tagline":"","name":"7xx0echochamber","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
